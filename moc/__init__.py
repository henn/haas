"""The ``moc`` package contains the former contents of ``moc-rest``::

    https://github.com/CCI-MOC/moc-rest

That library was split off from the main HaaS repo because we had plans to
use it in another codebase, but this never happened. It's been pulled back
into HaaS, but thus far the directory structure has been left untouched. It
will probably be reorganized in the near future.
